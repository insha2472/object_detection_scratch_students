# Student Portfolio

This is a simple static portfolio site. Open `index.html` in a browser to view.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `script.js` — small interactions (year, contact form handler)

How to use:

1. Open the file `stu_77/index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace sample text (name, about, projects) with your information.
3. Add `resume.pdf` to the same folder if you want the download link to work.
